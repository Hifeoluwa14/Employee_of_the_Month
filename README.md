# Employee_of_the_Month
Checks for Employee of the Month

This Python project determines the Employee of the Month based on the total number of hours worked by each employee. The employee with the highest recorded hours is awarded the title. In the event of a tie, where two or more employees have worked the same number of hours, they will share the award.
